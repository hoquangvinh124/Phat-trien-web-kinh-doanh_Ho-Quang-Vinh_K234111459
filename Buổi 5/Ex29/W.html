    <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #710c9c;">Doc-Centric Sales: West Region</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify; color:#710c9c;">Sales in the west were the most successful of the four regions. Some of Doc-Centric's success can be attributed to our long-standing base of customers. The sales of the M100-11 model were particularly encouraging. We anticipate even greater success in the current year. </p>
