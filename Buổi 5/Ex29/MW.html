    <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #d41111;">Doc-Centric Sales: Midwest Region</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify; color:#d41111;">The Midwest region had another strong sales year with record-setting sales of both the M300-25 and M100-11 models. The only disappointment was the lackluster sales of the M300-15 model, which started the year strong but tapered off into the fourth quarter. All-in-all though, a very good year for the Midwest region. </p>
