    <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #241299;">Doc-Centric Sales: Northeast Region</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify; color:#241299;">The Northeast region had a mixed sales year last year. Some models like the C300-25 performed admirably, while others like the C200-20 had disappointing years. 
        We anticipate a stronger year in current year with the introduction of the C300-30 model
         - a great copier at a competitive price.</p>
